# Resume-Screening-Application

This application is designed to process resumes by training a classifier, evaluate its performance, and make predictions on new resumes. It demonstrates proficiency in data preprocessing, machine learning modeling, and serialization techniques. The model is trained to predict the category of a resume based on its content, and the trained model is then applied to new data for predictions.
